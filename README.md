# Hangman
**Two player hangman game built with Python.**

## Description
This program is written in Python and allows two players to compete in a game of hangman. Player 1 will enter a word, that is hidden from player 2. Then player 2 will have to guess the word by guessing letters or words before they run out of attempts. If player 2 can guess the word player 1 entered, then player 2 wins. Otherwise, player 1 wins. After the game ends, you can choose to play again by entering 'Y' or exit the game by entering 'N'.
